## Description
The purpose of this course is to provide biology graduate students with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills for the analysis of next generation sequence data. The course will provide an overview of sequencing approaches, genome assembly, sequence alignment techniques and variant calling. The manipulation of genomic datasets using the commandline will  be taught through interactive tutorials. The unit will be presented as a series of short lectures and lab exercises over a three day period. 

## Instructors
Dr. Kathryn Hodgins and Dr. Paul Battlay

## Format
A mix of live/pre-recorded lectures and face to face lab exercises, running in a 2-hour block for each topic.

## Prequisites
Students should have basic knowledge in R and some command line knowledge (although the latter could be obtained during the course)

## Evaluation
Participation in discussions and lab exercises.

## Lectures/seminars
July 12, 13, 15th 2021

There are two sessions a day, from 11am to 1pm and from 1:30pm to 3:30pm.

## Basic course structure

The course material is organized in several topics, with slides and coding examples.

To get up to speed on working with a Unix system, take a look at the [unix help](resources/unix_ref.pdf) file. There are some resources there that will help you find the specific command you need for each task.

## Syllabus
1. [Topic 1](./Topic_1/) Introduction: Scope of course, goals, overview of technology and bioinformatics, and the future of sequencing 
2. [Topic 2](./Topic_2/) Programming for biologists 
3. [Topic 3](./Topic_3/) Fastq files and quality checking/trimming 
4. [Topic 4](./Topic_4/) Alignment: algorithms and tools
5. [Topic 5](./Topic_5/) Assembly: transcriptome and genome assembly 
6. [Topic 6](./Topic_6/) SNP and variant calling 

In previous years, there has been a short introduction to population genomcis and plotting in R. We have not included that topic this year, but the slides and materials are available for those who are interested:

7. [Topic 7](./Topic_8-9/) Population Genomics & Plotting in R
